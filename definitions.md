## Golden Path (generic)
A reference architecture for production-ready agentic AI systems, commonly described in three layers:
1) Core foundation (control plane)  
2) Agent layer (orchestration)  
3) Infrastructure + integration (production reality)

## Environment Control Layer (FAZON)
A control discipline that governs whether and when agent actions execute, and produces verifiable evidence for each run.

## Admissibility
A decision of whether the environment is suitable for a given class of action at a given time.

## Execution Gating
Controlling execution modes (e.g., HOLD vs SEND) based on admissibility and policy.

## Evidence Layer
A verifiable “why executed now?” run journal that supports accountability and auditing.
