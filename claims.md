# Claims — FAZON-REC-2026-01-27-GOLDENPATH-MAP-v1

C1. FAZON is not an orchestration framework; it is an Environment Control Layer for agent execution.  
C2. FAZON overlays the control plane with admissibility and evidence discipline.  
C3. FAZON wraps orchestration with execution gating and accountability artifacts.  
C4. FAZON treats production “boring parts” as a measurable discipline: Readiness + Governance + Evidence.  
C5. Evidence retention is necessary to explain “why executed now?” for accountable operations.
