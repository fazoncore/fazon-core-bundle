Record pack: Evidence Traces v1 (public-safe examples)

Three synthetic examples of governance-grade execution traces:
- HOLD: blocked (fail-closed)
- FRAGMENT: partial execution (safe subset only)
- SEND: executed within constrained scope

Each trace retains a verifiable “why now / why not now” decision record and artifact hashes (placeholders here).
No numeric thresholds or internal endpoints are disclosed.
